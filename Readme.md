### Interview Notes

#### Current System

Teachers currently have to manually enter assessment data into multiple places like ACS, Schoolbox, and an Excel calendar. This means there’s a lot of double handling and inconsistency between what’s written in each system. Different teachers use different naming styles and formats, so sometimes course titles or task names don’t match. Students also have to dig through clunky portals or shared spreadsheets to see their due dates, and they aren’t notified when things change. Overall, the system is time consuming and hard to use for both teachers and students.

#### Desired System

A system that makes entering and viewing assessments simpler for everyone. Teachers should be able to easily add assessments using drop-downs or predictive text so that everything is consistent. It should also show if there are any clashes with other subjects before finalising dates. Students should then be able to access a personalised calendar that only shows their subjects and tasks, ideally in a clean and easy-to-read layout. In the future, it could even notify students when assessment details are updated.

## Preplanning

### Define the Problems

#### Inconsistent Naming and Input

A consistent format or guideline for the excel sheet has not been established and thus the data been inputed is often all over the place and hard to read. Along with that some teacher input a large amount of data while others just the name of the assignemnt, creating a confusing experience.

#### Clunky and Redundant Systems



#### No Communication or Alerts



#### Assessment Clashes

Currently teachers can input an unlimited number of assignments on each day, which when it comes to subjects with very little to no overlap can be completly fine, but if many classes are shared this creates a very stressful time for students.

#### Poor Usability



### What problems will I solve

#### Teacher Data Entry

I will be improving on the current Excel data entry page for Teachers, this will hopefully make a more clear and streamlined process. My version of the Excel will create clear seperate sections for year 11 and 12 along with addign a section for each piece of key information, instead of the current system where there is only a single input field per day. Along with this inorder to reduce assesment clashes Michale has suggested limiting the number of assesments possibly due on a day, which i have included by ony providing three input fields per day.

#### Student Assessment Calendar - Ease of use and Accuracy

Currently the assesment calendar is just an excel sheet, spread out to students via schoolbox, where they then have to sort through and find only information relevant to them. I plan to fix this by creating a user interface which props the user to upload the same excel sheet from school box, then promps them for their name, which checks that against a look up table, hence softing the uploaded sheet for only relevant information, which it then displays.

#### Student Assesment Calendar - Data Standardisation and Accessibility

Provide consistant naming for assesments and a standard layout for the data.
